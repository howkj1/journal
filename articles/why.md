#Why 



## Why 

When I asked around about what tech/software people were using for podcast/screencasts I got some great recommendations.
Along with those recommendations, I was also asked similar questions like:

>"Why do you want to blog/make YouTube videos?"

and 

>"You planning to start cranking out digital content? What topic(s) if you don’t mind me asking?"

Well ...

### A couple of thoughts behind this endeavor:
#### Email is really blog/video/speaking topics
>"next time someone emails you... consider writing a blog post or adding to a wiki with your keystrokes, 
then emailing the link to the original emailer." - Scott Hanselman

I found this to be pretty profound, we spend time spinning our wheels with 1:1 interactions when we could be reaching a broader audience.

For optimising time see this article by Troy Hunt: 
> [How I optimised my life to make my job redundant](https://www.troyhunt.com/how-i-optimised-my-life-to-make-my-job/) 


If you combine the email/blog idea with Troy's optimization each email turns into a blog. 
The blog becomes the script for YouTube video and/or a talk.
Multiple blogs/videos/talks turn into a coarse(s).

Gary Vee is awesome and this video speaks for itself.

There's a quote I have always loved:

>“If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.”

― George Bernard Shaw

Hassan and I were talking about impact and helping others. Our talk could be summed up: 

>"if you teach a man to fish... but if you teach YouTube how to fish, you have shown the world how to fish."

Whether it is self-promotion or helping others, you can ask, how best can I reach others and where is the biggest potential impact?

## What?

All things (even outside tech) would I blog / vlog about?

- tdd
- node
- vim/spacemacs, tmux, dotfiles (USING TORAN'S DOTFILES)
- ember with ember-cordova / corber.io
- podcast/interviews

Short form or in-depth long form, if there's something you're interested in or can speak about then it's probably worth a blog/video/talk.
